* Replacing the two dimensional array with a simpler one dimensional array

* Refactor gameState enum from
  ['currentlyPlaying','tie','winnerX','winnerO'] > ['currentlyPlaying','tie','winner']
  * use currentPlayer to determine who moved last/won

* Lift Status + helper out of 'Board', more fit to live in 'Game'

* Board-Row jsx could be abstracted into a helper to reduce repeated code

* Could probably spend some time contemplating a more graceful solution to win state calculations,
  using chained expressions like we currently do feels ham-fisted.
  It would feel better to iterate through the state

* Instead of passing gameState to Square, create a prop for Square called 'disabled'
  and give prop the gameState expression

Doug added:
- state collocation -- grid
- more tightly scoped reducers/state-setters 
    - e.g. setWin() vs. setDraw()
- enum of winner -- eliminating the magic string
